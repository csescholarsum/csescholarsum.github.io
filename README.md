This is the website for Code-M. Contribute, add things. Just make a PR if you want them to go live!

## How To Contribute

To get started with Github and contribute to the repo do the following:

1. [Get a Github account](https://github.com/join)
2. Ask to become a contributer or fork the repository.
3. [Download the Github UI](  https://desktop.github.com/) for your operating system. (Optionally, use the terminal).
4. In the UI, clone the repository to a location on your machine or create a fork of the repo and clone that.
5. In the UI, make a branch with your name (or use your fork of the repo)
6. With a text editor, contribute to the project.
7. In the UI, make a pull request to the master branch on the repo (similar process for forks)
8. Get another collaborator to look at your work and merge it in.
9. Rinse and Repeat (steps 6-8)
